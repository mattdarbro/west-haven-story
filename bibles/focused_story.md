**Goal:** Introduce Julia and establish the station

**Opening Scene:**
Julia's luxury corporate shuttle shakes violently. Alarms screaming. Emergency systems failing - corporate negligence, deferred maintenance finally catching up. She manages to pilot the failing ship toward the only signature on sensors: FS-7, supposedly decommissioned. The landing is rough - she survives but ship is totaled.

**Key Revelations:**
- Julia is burned out, this was supposed to be her first vacation in five years
- She doesn't recognize FS-7 as her father's station yet
- West Haven has life support and people - impossible for "abandoned" station

**Character Moments:**
- **Kieran:** Finds her in wreckage, competent rescue, wary but kind
- **Lina:** First friendly face, treats injuries without judgment
- **Maren:** Brief appearance, clearly assessing the new arrival

**Success Criteria:**
Julia accepts temporary shelter and allows Lina to treat her injuries

**Tone:** Disorienting, tense, but first hints of warmth
**Pacing:** Fast crash sequence, then slow down for recovery

-----

### Beat 2: "First Impressions"

**Goal:** Julia discovers West Haven is thriving, not dying

**Opening Scene:**
Morning in temporary quarters. Julia wakes to unfamiliar sounds - children laughing, people greeting each other, life. Kieran arrives to give her the station tour, assess ship damage.

**Key Revelations:**
- This "abandoned" station has fifty-plus residents building a life
- People chose to stay - weren't just "stuck"
- Community functions with surprising efficiency

**Character Moments:**
- **Kieran:** Tour guide, defends the station with quiet pride, first hints of chemistry

- Engineering bay (seeing Kieran's workspace)

-----

### Beat 3: "The Forgotten Zones"

**Goal:** Julia discovers the station's history and her connection

**Opening Scene:**
Finn approaches Julia with a proposal: He found components in the sealed sections that might help repair her ship. Adventure calls. Kieran reluctantly agrees to supervise.

**Key Revelations:**
- The station is much larger than what's currently inhabited
- Julia starts recognizing design elements - elegant, intentional, familiar
- Discovery: Richard Martin's name on a sealed workshop

**Key Discovery:**
In Richard's workshop, Julia finds:
- His design sketches for FS-7 (original vision)
- Personal logs about fighting FPC to preserve integrity
- A photo of young Julia with him, both covered in grease, both smiling
- Prototype components for the secondary power system

**The Moment:**
Julia, looking at her father's sketches: "He designed this? All of this?"
Kieran, gently: "Yes. This was his masterwork. Before FPC gutted it."

-----

### Beat 4: "The Crisis Revealed"

**Goal:** Power crisis becomes urgent, Julia sees her hidden skills emerge

**Opening Scene:**
Major power surge. Alarms throughout station. Kieran sprints to engineering. Julia follows. The main reactor is failing faster than expected - three months becomes critical.

**Key Revelations:**
- Station has three months of power left, maximum
- Without power: no life support, no water, no heat - they die
- Julia realizes: her rescue is their death sentence (distress beacon drew attention)

**The Critical Moment:**
Julia instinctively solves an immediate crisis using engineering knowledge:

Julia: "Wait, that routing is wrong. The CO2 is cycling back—"
Kieran: "What?"
Julia: "If you bypass through hydroponics... here, let me show you."

It works. Crisis stabilized (for now).

Kieran: "Julia. Who are you? Really?"

-----

### Beat 5: "The Dreamer's Blueprint"

**Goal:** The model kit reveals the solution; Julia and Kieran grow closer

**Opening Scene:**
Julia opens the model kit for the first time. Inside: Intricate components, detailed technical specifications, fold-out blueprints. And her father's handwriting: *"Remember: A station isn't just engineering. It's a home."*

Kieran knocks. "Can't sleep either?" She shows him the kit. His eyes widen: "Julia… this is… We've been searching for these designs for five years."

**Key Revelations:**
- Model kit is "FS-7 Dreamer's Blueprint Edition" - her father's ORIGINAL design
- Shows systems FPC never built, including secondary power infrastructure
- The solution to the power crisis is IN THE MODEL
- FPC cut the secondary system to save money

**The Technical Discovery:**
Julia: "The secondary power system… it's not a backup. It's a network."
Kieran: "What do you mean?"
Julia: "Solar collection, bio-reactors, algae photosynthesis... They all feed each other. It's an ecosystem, not a machine."

**Romantic Development:**
Late night. Model complete. Both exhausted.
Kieran: "You carried hope. That's everything."
He almost kisses her. Stops.

-----

### Beat 6: "All Hands"

**Goal:** Community mobilizes to build secondary power system

**Opening Scene:**
Community gathering in the Citadel. The Dreamer's Blueprint model sits on display. Kieran and Julia present the plan. Skepticism, hope, questions, and ultimately: commitment.

**Key Revelations:**
- Building the secondary system requires everyone's unique skills
- Reyna's "useless" research is crucial (her algae strains perfect for bio-reactors)
- Maren reveals she has the third hologram - "Your father left this for you. I've kept it safe."

**Key Scenes:**
- Solar Panel Walk: Kieran and Julia in EVA suits, working together, stars everywhere
- Late Night Engineering: Julia and Kieran, alone, exhausted - he kisses her. She kisses back. Finally.
- Community Celebration: First major milestone reached

-----

### Beat 7: "The Test"

**Goal:** First integration test fails; crisis of faith

**Opening Scene:**
Engineering bay packed with community. Kieran: "Activating secondary power systems… now."
Lights flicker. Systems hum. It's working! People cheer—
Then: Cascade failure. Alarms. Emergency shutdown. Silence.

**Key Revelations:**
- The system works in theory but not in practice
- Something's missing from the specifications
- Julia realizes she needs to watch her father's holograms

**Julia and Kieran's First Fight:**
Kieran: "Then the specs are wrong."
Julia, defensive: "My father didn't make mistakes."
Kieran: "He was human, Julia. Maybe he—"
Julia: "Don't. Just… don't."

**The Decision:**
Julia picks up the third hologram chip. Hesitates. Inserts it.
Her father's face appears.
**Beat ends with:** "Hello, Julia. If you're watching this…"

-----

### Beat 8: "The Third Hologram"

**Goal:** Julia receives her father's wisdom and discovers the missing piece

**The Hologram's Contents:**
Richard: "The secondary power system I designed? It's not a machine. It's an ecosystem. You can't force it to work. You have to let it… breathe. Grow. Find its own balance.

The bio-systems need time to adapt to each other. The algae have to learn the environment. You're not building a power plant. You're cultivating a garden that happens to generate electricity.

Give it time. Give it patience. Give it love.

I love you, Julia. I always did. I always will. Build something beautiful."

**Julia's Response:**
She understands. "You're not building a power plant. You're cultivating a garden."
She runs to the greenhouse to find Reyna.

**Finding Kieran:**
Julia: "I know what we did wrong. We treated it like a machine. But it's alive. The systems need time to adapt to each other."

**Hope Rekindled:**
They present the revised plan: Gradual integration. Let the biology adapt.
Julia: "My father designed this station to be resilient. To adapt. To live. We just have to trust it."

-----

### Beat 9: "The Documents"

**Goal:** Julia discovers her complicity; legal crisis emerges

**Opening Scene:**
Week two of integration. Systems stabilizing beautifully. Julia is happy - truly happy - for the first time in years.
Then: Routine data packet from her FPC office. She opens it. And her world shatters.

**Key Revelations:**
- Julia personally authored the legal framework allowing FPC to reclaim "abandoned" stations
- FS-7 qualifies under HER protocols
- FPC salvage operation scheduled in 4 weeks
- If West Haven goes dark, FPC can legally scrap it immediately

**The Confession:**
Julia calls community meeting. No armor now. Just guilt and determination.
Julia: "I need to tell you something. And you're going to hate me. You should hate me."
She explains everything.

**The Vote:**
Maren: "We vote. Does Julia stay and fight for us?"
Hands raise. Not everyone votes yes. But enough.
Maren: "Julia Martin, we accept your help. Prove you're not them anymore."

**The Legal Strategy:**
"Operational Continuity Clause" - If a station achieves full operational status per original specifications, ownership transfers to residents.
File emergency injunction to halt salvage. Prove West Haven meets all criteria before FPC deadline.

-----

### Beat 10: "The Integration"

**Goal:** Power systems fully integrate; community prepares for legal hearing

**Opening Scene:**
Week three. Engineering bay. Final phase of power integration.
Kieran: "Ready?"
Julia: "Do it."
He activates full integration. Systems light up. Green across the board. The old reactor powers down.
It works. It actually works.

**Key Revelations:**
- Secondary power system fully operational
- West Haven is now truly self-sustaining
- FPC sends representative to verify: Patricia Chen, Julia's former boss

**Patricia's Inspection:**
Patricia tours the station. Professional but increasingly moved.
Patricia: "This is… extraordinary. The integration is beyond our original specifications."

**Preparation for Hearing:**
Each person prepares to speak:
- Maren: Historical record
- Kieran: Technical documentation
- Reyna: Scientific breakthrough
- Dutch: Original construction testimony (recorded while lucid)

**Kieran and Julia:**
Observation deck. Stars everywhere.
Kieran: "I love you. I love your brilliant mind. Your hidden artist's hands. All of it."
Julia: "I love you too. And I'm not leaving. Regardless of the hearing. This is home now."
They kiss. Below them, West Haven pulses with life.

-----

### Beat 11: "The Hearing"

**Goal:** Legal battle for West Haven's independence

**Opening Scene:**
Space Commerce Court. Formal hearing room. FPC legal team on one side. West Haven delegation on the other. Gallery packed with journalists.

**Julia's Opening:**
"Your Honor, my name is Julia Martin. I am the daughter of Richard Martin, FS-7's original architect. I am also the author of the Station Decommissioning Protocols being invoked today.

I wrote those protocols three years ago. I wrote them well - perhaps too well. That was wrong. I'm here to correct that error.

FPC never filed Richard Martin's original specifications. They filed a modified version. The residents have not just met the original specifications. They've exceeded them."

**Key Testimonies:**
- Dutch (recorded): "Richard built FS-7 to be a home. These residents proved what he knew: communities will build something corporations never could. Hope."
- Maren: "We proved community matters more than quarterly earnings."
- Patricia: "West Haven proves the Martin design philosophy works. We should learn from that, not destroy it."

**Alexander Biltrigard Speaks:**
Biltrigard: "I've listened to this testimony. These people accomplished something our engineers said was impossible. I don't want to salvage West Haven. I want to learn from it. FPC withdraws its salvage claim."

**Judge's Ruling:**
"I rule in favor of the claimants. Ownership of FS-7, to be known as West Haven, transfers to the resident community effective immediately. Congratulations. You're homeowners."

-----

### Beat 12: "Home"

**Goal:** Resolution, future, belonging, completion of all arcs

**The Celebration:**
Community celebration. Music, dancing, joy.
Maren: "Today, we are no longer refugees. We are citizens of West Haven, the first self-governing orbital community. We are free."

**Julia and Kieran:**
Observation deck. Stars. Station humming beneath them.
Julia: "I love you, Kieran Page. I want to build a life here. With you. For real."
He pulls out a ring made from salvaged materials.
Kieran: "It's not fancy—"
Julia: "It's perfect. Yes. Absolutely yes."

**Character Resolutions:**
- Maren passes her chronicles to Sage: "Your turn to remember."
- Finn to Sage: "Would you maybe want to have dinner? Just us?"
- Reyna: Her research published, other stations requesting her algae
- Dutch: Memory failing but at peace
- Marcus & Eloise: Café expanding
- Zed: Planning for success instead of just failure

**The Model's Home:**
Plaque beneath displayed model:
*"FS-7: The Dreamer's Blueprint
Designed by Richard Martin
Realized by the People of West Haven
'Build something beautiful.'"*

**Final Scene:**
Six months later. West Haven has 73 residents. Julia pregnant. Consulting for FPC's new Martin Protocol stations.
Julia in the greenhouse, sketching designs.

Julia: "Ready to go build something?"
Kieran: "Always."

**THE END**

-----

## Themes

### Primary Theme: "Hope Is Built, Not Found"

Hopepunk philosophy at its core - hope is an active choice, requiring work and community. West Haven didn't survive through luck - through effort, creativity, cooperation.

### Secondary Theme: "Identity Integration"

Julia doesn't choose between corporate lawyer and builder - she integrates both. Uses legal skills FOR people. Embraces engineering passion AND professional expertise.

### Tertiary Theme: "Legacy and Redemption"

Richard "failed" but his vision ultimately succeeds through others. Julia enabled corporate abandonment but uses those skills to prevent it. Past mistakes don't define future.

-----

## Content Rating: PG

**Violence:** None. Some peril (space dangers, system failures) but no combat or graphic injury
**Language:** Mild only. "Hell," "damn" acceptable
**Romance:** Kissing, hand-holding, embracing. Implied future intimacy (pregnancy in epilogue) but no explicit content
**Themes:** Complex but hopeful. Death mentioned (Dutch's declining health) but handled gently

**Appropriate for:** Ages 10+ with parental guidance, 13+ independently

-----

## Key Locations

### The Citadel (Central Hub)
Three-story cylindrical space at station's center where five main corridors converge. Community gathering space with café, bulletin boards, observation deck. Warm lighting contrasts with cold space outside.

### The Greenhouse (Reyna's Domain)
Originally small hydroponics bay, transformed into West Haven's lungs and soul. Multiple levels of growth trays, algae tanks, experimental gardens. Humid, alive, peaceful.
