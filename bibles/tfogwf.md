## Synopsis
Elena Storm awakens in the ruins of the Forgotten Citadel with no memory of how she arrived. Ancient whispers speak of a prophecy—one that foretells the return of a hero who will either save or destroy the realm. As Elena explores the crumbling halls, she discovers she possesses an unexplainable connection to the Citadel's dark magic. But power always demands a price, and the shadows that lurk in these ruins hunger for more than just souls.

  - Underground passages filled with ancient murals
  - Void Gate - a portal sealed by blood magic
  - Hall of Echoes - where the past replays itself
- **Visual Style**: Gothic ruins, dark fantasy, bioluminescent elements, corruption spreading through beautiful architecture

## Story Beats

### Beat 1: The Awakening
**Goal**: Introduce Elena, establish the inciting incident, and create atmosphere

**Opening Scene**: Elena awakens on cold stone, head pounding, surrounded by ruins. The last thing she remembers is following a dream that led her here. Now she can't find the way out.

**Key Revelations**:
- Elena has unexplained connection to the Citadel (torches light as she passes)
- Ancient whispers speak her name (but which name?)
- She finds a mural depicting a figure who looks like her, standing before the Void Gate

**Challenges**:
- Navigate crumbling architecture
- Hear conflicting whispers (The Shadow vs The Voice)
- Discover she can manipulate the Citadel's magic instinctively

**Success Criteria**: Elena touches the Crystal Spire and receives her first vision—a glimpse of two futures: one where she opens the Void Gate in triumph, another where she lies dead at its threshold

**Player Choices**:
1. Seek answers from the whispers (trusting, explores lore)
2. Try to break free using her emerging powers (aggressive, direct)
3. Search for another way out (cautious, investigates environment)

**Tone**: Mysterious, disorienting, building dread

**Foreshadowing**:
- Marcus's warning echoes in her mind
- The runes on her skin glow brighter near the Spire
- Shadows move unnaturally, as if watching

**Next Beat Trigger**: Elena makes a choice about the vision—will she seek to understand it or reject prophecy entirely?

---

### Beat 2: The First Trial
**Goal**: Test Elena's abilities and force her first major moral choice

**Opening**: After the vision, the Citadel responds to Elena's decision. A path opens to the Hall of Echoes, where past events replay like ghosts. Here, Elena witnesses what happened to the Citadel's last mages.

**Key Revelations**:
- The prophecy isn't about saving the world—it's about choosing which world survives
- Elena is the reincarnation (or echo) of the mage who created the Void Gate
- The Shadow was once her bound companion, sealed away when she sacrificed herself
- Opening the Gate doesn't release evil—it resets reality to before the catastrophe

**Challenges**:
- Shadow creatures emerge (manifestations of regret and fear)
- Must use magic she doesn't understand
- The Voice warns her: "Power remembers, even when flesh forgets"
- The Shadow tempts her: "You were magnificent once. Be yourself again."

**Moral Choice**: Elena finds a wounded shadow creature—a former mage, transformed by the Citadel's curse. It begs for death. Does she:
1. Grant mercy and end its suffering (compassionate, accepts burden)
2. Try to save it using untrained magic (hopeful, risky)
3. Leave it and move on (pragmatic, self-preserving)

**Success Criteria**: Elena survives the Hall of Echoes and reaches the chamber beneath the Void Gate. She finds her own name carved in ancient stone: "Elara Stormbringer, First of the Bound."

**Player Choices Shape**:
- Elena's relationship with her power (fear it, embrace it, question it)
- The Shadow's dialogue and influence (grows stronger or weaker)
- Visual corruption spreading (more darkness or more light)

**Tone**: Tense, revelatory, emotionally heavy

**Foreshadowing**:
- The choice made here determines which entities aid Elena in Beat 3
- Magic used here leaves marks (literal and metaphorical)

**Next Beat Trigger**: Elena must decide: reclaim her identity as Elara and her power, or reject the past and forge a new path

---

### Beat 3: The Price of Power
**Goal**: Climactic choice that determines the ending

**Opening**: Elena stands before the Void Gate. The seal is breaking. The Shadow speaks clearly now, no longer whispering: "You wanted truth. Here it is. Open the Gate and undo the mistake. Close it forever and condemn two realms to slow death. Or take the third path—the one I took last time—and become the seal yourself."

**Key Revelations**:
- The "catastrophe" was a mergence of two realities, creating a paradox
- The Void Gate can separate them, but someone must hold the realms apart
- Elara chose to become the seal last time, fragmenting herself across lifetimes
- Elena's memory loss wasn't random—it's the cost of being reborn
- Marcus knew what she was and didn't tell her (his notes are found here)

**Challenges**:
- The Citadel is collapsing as the seal breaks
- Shadow creatures pour from cracks in reality
- Time is fragmented—past, present, future blur
- Elena must use everything learned in Beats 1 and 2

**The Three Paths**:

**Path 1: Open the Gate**
- Elena embraces her identity as Elara fully
- Uses her power to reset reality to before the merge
- Consequence: She erases this timeline, including everyone she's met since awakening
- The Shadow is freed and grateful, hints it will remember her
- ENDING: Elena wakes in a different world, memories intact, truly powerful, alone

**Path 2: Seal the Gate Forever**
- Elena rejects prophecy and forces the Gate closed with raw power
- The realms remain merged but collapsing slowly
- Consequence: She burns out her connection to magic, becoming fully human
- The Voice thanks her for choosing a mortal life over divine purpose
- ENDING: Elena escapes as the Citadel falls, finds Marcus, they search for another solution together

**Path 3: Become the Seal**
- Elena chooses the same sacrifice Elara made
- Binds herself to the Gate, holding the realms apart
- Consequence: She fragments again, will be reborn with no memories
- The cycle continues, but reality is stable
- ENDING: Elena dissolves into light. Years later, a young woman awakens in a forest, no memory, a strange scar on her hand

**Success Criteria**: Player makes a choice that feels emotionally earned based on their journey

**Tone**: Epic, tragic, cathartic

**Epilogue**: Brief scene based on chosen path, hinting at consequences

**Next Beat Trigger**: (For future expansion) Each ending opens different story branches

## Themes

### Primary Theme: Destiny vs. Choice
- Is Elena doomed to repeat Elara's choice?
- Can you escape a prophecy by refusing to believe in it?
- What if your destiny is to choose?

### Secondary Theme: Identity
- Are you the sum of your memories?
- If you were someone else in a past life, are you still them?
- Can power define you if you don't remember earning it?

### Tertiary Theme: Sacrifice
- Is sacrifice noble if you won't remember making it?
- Can you sacrifice someone you used to be?
- What's worth saving: individuals or worlds?

## Lore

### The Prophecy (translated from murals)
> *"When the Fallen rises twice,*
> *And stone remembers blood,*
> *The Gate shall hunger for its key,*
> *And worlds shall drown in should-have-been.*
>
> *Three paths branch from broken crown:*
> *The power to unmake,*
> *The courage to refuse,*
> *The love to fade forgotten.*
>
> *Only she who fell can rise,*
> *Only she who rose can fall,*
> *Only she who is neither—*
> *Can be both and save all."*

### Magic System
- **Prophecy Magic**: Allows glimpses of possible futures, but seeing futures changes them
- **Binding Magic**: Creates connections between entities/realms, requires consent or sacrifice
- **Corruption**: Using magic you don't understand leaves marks—physical and mental
- **Cost**: All magic demands payment—prophecy magic costs memories

### Historical Event: The Sundering
- 300 years ago, two parallel realities began merging
- Mages of the Citadel tried to stop it
- They created the Void Gate to separate the realms
- Required a mage to become a living seal
- Elara Stormbringer volunteered
- Her sacrifice worked but fragmented her across time

## Dialogue Examples

### The Shadow
- *"You fear me because you fear yourself. We were magnificent together."*
- *"Every lifetime, you make the same choice. Perhaps this time, choose differently?"*
- *"I am not your enemy, Elara. I am your consequence."*

### The Voice
- *"They called it mercy. I called it cowardice. She should have let it all burn."*
- *"You are not her. You are who she could have been."*
- *"Run, child. This place devours those who linger."*

### Elena's Internal Monologue
- *"Marcus said curiosity would kill me. He wasn't wrong. Just... not yet."*
- *"I've lost my past. I won't lose my future to it."*
- *"These aren't my memories. So why do they hurt?"*

## Visual Guidelines

### Color Palette
- Primary: Deep purples, midnight blues, shadow blacks
- Accent: Sickly green bioluminescence, blood red runes
- Contrast: Pure white (Elena's magic), golden cracks (the Citadel breaking)

### Image Generation Prompts (Examples)

**Beat 1 Opening**:
*"A young woman with dark hair awakens on ancient stone floor, gothic ruins around her, luminescent moss glowing faintly, towering crystal spire in distance pulsing with purple light, atmospheric fog, dark fantasy art, detailed architecture, cinematic lighting"*

**Beat 2 Hall of Echoes**:
*"Vast hall with crumbling pillars, ghostly figures replaying ancient scenes, shadow creatures emerging from walls, protagonist wielding unstable magic, purple and blue energy swirls, dark fantasy, dramatic lighting, ethereal atmosphere"*

**Beat 3 Void Gate**:
*"Massive stone archway covered in glowing red runes, darkness swirling within portal, young woman standing before it, light versus shadow, reality fracturing around her, epic scale, dark fantasy, emotional climax, divine power"*

## Notes for Narrative Generation

### Pacing
- Beat 1: Slow, exploratory, building tension
- Beat 2: Medium, revelations and action balanced
- Beat 3: Fast, urgent, emotionally intense

### Player Agency
- Choices should feel meaningful but not overwhelming
- Consequences should be logical and foreshadowed
- No "right" answer—all paths are valid

### Tone Consistency
- Dark but not grimdark—there's beauty in the ruins
- Serious but allow moments of levity (Elena's sarcasm)
- Emotional but not melodramatic

### Continuity Checks
- Reference player's previous choices in dialogue
- Acknowledge consequences of Beat 1/2 decisions in Beat 3
- Track which entities Elena trusts based on choices
