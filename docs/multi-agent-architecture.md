# Multi-Agent Story Generation Architecture

## Overview

This document describes the redesigned story generation system using a multi-agent architecture with RAG-based consistency checking.

**Key Insight:** Two-level beat system - story structure beats (novel-level) + chapter beats (chapter-level)

---

## Agent Definitions

### 1. Story Structure Beat Agent (SSBA)
**Purpose:** Maintains overall story arc across all 30 chapters using Save the Cat structure

**When it runs:**
- **Chapter 1:** Full story planning (creates complete story arc)
- **Chapters 2-30:** Lightweight check-in (monitors progression, provides context)

**Input (Chapter 1):**
- World template
- Genre
- Story bible (initial)
- Total chapters (default: 30)

**Output (Chapter 1):**
```json
{
  "story_structure": {
    "act_1": {
      "opening_image": {"chapters": [1], "description": "Establish ordinary world on space station"},
      "theme_stated": {"chapters": [1-2], "description": "Hint at isolation vs connection"},
      "setup": {"chapters": [1-3], "description": "Introduce characters, relationships, station life"},
      "catalyst": {"chapters": [3-4], "description": "Mysterious signal detected"},
      "debate": {"chapters": [4-5], "description": "Should they investigate or report?"}
    },
    "act_2a": {
      "break_into_2": {"chapters": [6], "description": "Decision to investigate secretly"},
      "b_story": {"chapters": [6-8], "description": "Romance subplot develops"},
      "fun_and_games": {"chapters": [7-12], "description": "Explore signal source, discoveries"},
      "midpoint": {"chapters": [13-14], "description": "False victory: decrypt signal, reveal danger"}
    },
    "act_2b": {
      "bad_guys_close_in": {"chapters": [15-20], "description": "Station command suspicious, external threat"},
      "all_is_lost": {"chapters": [21-22], "description": "Discovery exposed, consequences"},
      "dark_night_of_soul": {"chapters": [23], "description": "Protagonist questions everything"}
    },
    "act_3": {
      "break_into_3": {"chapters": [24], "description": "New plan formulated"},
      "finale": {"chapters": [25-29], "description": "Confrontation and resolution"},
      "final_image": {"chapters": [30], "description": "New normal established"}
    }
  },
  "key_arcs": {
    "protagonist_arc": "Isolated engineer → Community leader",
    "romance_arc": "Mutual distrust → Deep partnership",
    "station_arc": "Safe haven → Dangerous frontier"
  }
}
```

**Input (Chapters 2-30):**
- Current chapter number
- Story structure (from Chapter 1)
- Story bible (updated)
- Previous chapter summaries (last 3)

**Output (Chapters 2-30):**
```json
{
  "current_story_beat": "fun_and_games",
  "act": "2a",
  "progress_percentage": 35.5,
  "guidance_for_cba": "We're in Act 2A - exploration phase. Create chapter beats that reveal discoveries and deepen relationships. Tone: wonder with underlying tension.",
  "upcoming_milestone": "Approaching midpoint (chapter 13-14) - start building toward false victory",
  "character_arcs_status": {
    "protagonist": "Learning to trust others, 40% through arc",
    "love_interest": "Opening up about past, 35% through arc"
  },
  "inconsistency_resolutions": [
    {
      "flag_id": "charlie_mobility_ch15",
      "resolution_plan": "Chapter 16 reveals experimental nerve regeneration treatment - turn contradiction into plot twist",
      "integrated_into_beat": "midpoint",
      "narrative_approach": "False victory - treatment seems to work but has hidden cost"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### 2. Chapter Beat Agent (CBA)
**Purpose:** Creates 6-beat structure for the current chapter

**When it runs:** Every chapter (1-30)

**Input (Chapter 1):**
- SSBA story structure
- Story bible
- World template

**Input (Chapters 2-30):**
- SSBA check-in output
- Story bible
- Player's last choice
- Last 6 chapter summaries

**Output:**
```json
{
  "chapter_beats": [
    {
      "beat_number": 1,
      "beat_name": "Opening Hook",
      "scene": "Charlie wheels through empty corridor, notices oxygen readings fluctuating",
      "key_actions": [
        "Charlie checks tablet while navigating to control room",
        "Passes crew quarters - everyone asleep",
        "Hears unusual hum from ventilation system"
      ],
      "characters_present": ["Charlie"],
      "location": "Level 3 corridor, near control room",
      "emotional_tone": "Uneasy calm, growing concern",
      "time_estimate": "Late night, 0300 hours",
      "story_beat_alignment": "fun_and_games - discovery phase"
    },
    {
      "beat_number": 2,
      "beat_name": "Rising Action",
      "scene": "Charlie investigates control panel, discovers anomaly pattern",
      "key_actions": [
        "Accesses main control terminal",
        "Runs diagnostic on life support systems",
        "Discovers pattern matches signal frequency from Chapter 7"
      ],
      "characters_present": ["Charlie", "Station AI (voice only)"],
      "location": "Main control room",
      "emotional_tone": "Focused tension, intellectual excitement",
      "time_estimate": "15 minutes later",
      "story_beat_alignment": "fun_and_games - connecting clues"
    }
    // ... beats 3-6
  ],
  "chapter_goal": "Charlie discovers connection between station anomalies and the mysterious signal",
  "chapter_tension": "Will Charlie investigate alone or wake the crew?",
  "setup_for_next": "Decision point about whether to bring others into investigation"
}
```

---

### 3. Context Editor Agent (CEA)
**Purpose:** RAG-based consistency checking + strategic choice generation

**When it runs:** Chapters 2-30 only (Chapter 1 has no context to check)

**Input:**
- CBA chapter beats (unvalidated)
- SSBA story position guidance
- RAG vector store (all previous chapters as paragraph chunks)
- Story bible

**Process:**
1. Extract entities from CBA beats: characters, locations, objects, facts
2. For each entity, query RAG store for relevant past mentions
3. Identify contradictions or inconsistencies
4. Auto-fix contradictions in beat plan
5. **Generate 3 strategic choices** based on validated beats + story position

**Output:**
```json
{
  "revised_chapter_beats": [ /* same structure as CBA, but corrected */ ],
  "choices": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "text": "She decided to investigate alone, keeping this discovery secret as...",
      "tone": "bold",
      "story_consequence": "Pushes toward 'midpoint revelation' faster",
      "consistency_validated": true
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "text": "She called Torres on the secure channel, knowing she'd need backup as...",
      "tone": "cautious",
      "story_consequence": "Strengthens relationship arc, slower pacing",
      "consistency_validated": true,
      "rag_check": "Torres confirmed available (Chapter 12, in engineering)"
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "text": "She paused, weighing the risks before deciding to...",
      "tone": "thoughtful",
      "story_consequence": "Allows player agency on pacing",
      "consistency_validated": true
    }
  ],
  "consistency_checks": [
    {
      "beat_number": 1,
      "entity": "Charlie",
      "issue": "Original beat said 'Charlie walks through corridor'",
      "rag_finding": "Chapter 3, paragraph 12: 'The explosion left Charlie dependent on his wheelchair'",
      "correction": "Changed to 'Charlie wheels through corridor'",
      "auto_fixed": true,
      "confidence": 0.95
    },
    {
      "beat_number": 2,
      "entity": "Dr. Sarah Chen",
      "issue": "Original beat included Dr. Chen in control room",
      "rag_finding": "Chapter 11, paragraph 45: 'Dr. Chen departed for Earth on supply shuttle'",
      "correction": "Replaced Dr. Chen with Lieutenant Torres",
      "auto_fixed": true,
      "confidence": 0.88
    },
    {
      "beat_number": 2,
      "entity": "signal frequency",
      "issue": "Beat mentions 'signal frequency from Chapter 7'",
      "rag_finding": "Chapter 7, paragraph 23: 'The signal pulsed at 2.4 GHz, matching old radio astronomy band'",
      "correction": "Added detail: 'matches the 2.4 GHz pattern'",
      "auto_fixed": true,
      "confidence": 0.92
    }
  ],
  "rag_queries_performed": 15,
  "contradictions_found": 3,
  "auto_corrections_made": 3,
  "inconsistency_flags": [
    {
      "flag_id": "charlie_mobility_ch15",
      "severity": "high",
      "description": "Player choice implied Charlie walked independently, but Chapter 3 established wheelchair dependency",
      "rag_evidence": "Chapter 3, paragraph 12: 'The explosion left Charlie dependent on his wheelchair'",
      "suggested_resolution": "Reveal experimental treatment or retcon injury severity",
      "flag_for_ssba": true
    }
  ]
}
```

**RAG Implementation Details:**
- **Vector Store:** Chroma (local, free)
- **Chunk Size:** Paragraph-level (each paragraph is a separate embedding)
- **Embedding Model:** OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (cheap, fast) or Anthropic's if available
- **Retrieval:** Top 5 most relevant chunks per entity query
- **Metadata stored with chunks:**
  ```json
  {
    "chapter_number": 7,
    "paragraph_number": 23,
    "characters_mentioned": ["Charlie", "Torres"],
    "locations_mentioned": ["control room"],
    "themes": ["mystery", "discovery"],
    "beat": "fun_and_games"
  }
  ```

### 4. Prose Agent (PA)
**Purpose:** Write 2500-word narrative prose from validated beat plan (PROSE ONLY - no strategic decisions)

**Input (Chapter 1):**
- CBA chapter beats (no CEA validation)
- Story bible
- World template
- Choices (generated separately for Chapter 1)

**Input (Chapters 2-30):**
- CEA revised chapter beats + validated choices
- Story bible
- Player's last choice (continuation text)
- Last 3 chapter summaries

**Output:**
```json
{
  "narrative": "The emergency klaxons screamed through the corridors...",  // ~2500 words
  "image_prompt": "Space station control room, dramatic lighting, holographic displays",
  "story_bible_update": {
    "key_events": ["Charlie discovered oxygen anomaly pattern"],
    "locations": {
      "level_3_corridor": "Dimly lit hallway between crew quarters and control room"
    }
  },
  "beat_progress": 1.0
}
```

**Key differences from current system:**
- PA now follows a structured beat plan instead of generating everything from scratch
- **PA does NOT generate choices** - choices come from CEA (or simple generation for Chapter 1)
- PA focuses purely on prose quality and story bible updates
- This separation of concerns should:
  - Reduce hallucinations
  - Improve consistency (choices validated by CEA)
  - Maintain quality prose
  - Actually be FASTER (less creative load on PA)

---

## Data Structures

### Story State Updates

**New fields to add:**

```python
class StoryState(TypedDict):
    # ... existing fields ...

    # SSBA outputs
    story_structure: dict  # Full story arc (set in chapter 1)
    current_story_beat: str  # Current Save the Cat beat (updated each chapter)
    story_progress_pct: float  # Overall story completion %

    # CBA outputs
    chapter_beat_plan: dict  # Current chapter's 6-beat plan

    # CEA outputs
    consistency_report: dict  # Last consistency check results

    # RAG metadata
    rag_chunks_indexed: int  # Total paragraph chunks in vector store
    last_rag_update: str  # Timestamp of last vector store update

    # Inconsistency tracking (CEA → SSBA communication)
    inconsistency_flags: list[dict]  # Active flags for irreconcilable contradictions
```

### Vector Store Schema

**Collection name:** `west_haven_story_{session_id}`

**Document structure:**
```python
{
    "id": "ch7_p23",
    "text": "The signal pulsed at 2.4 GHz, matching the old radio astronomy band. Charlie's eyes widened as he recognized the pattern.",
    "metadata": {
        "chapter_number": 7,
        "paragraph_number": 23,
        "characters": ["Charlie"],
        "locations": ["control room"],
        "entities": ["signal", "2.4 GHz", "radio astronomy"],
        "themes": ["mystery", "discovery"],
        "story_beat": "fun_and_games",
        "emotional_tone": "excitement"
    }
}
```

## Configuration Options

**Add to `backend/config.py`:**

```python
# RAG Configuration
ENABLE_RAG_CONSISTENCY = True  # Master switch for CEA
RAG_CHUNK_SIZE = "paragraph"  # "paragraph" or "sentence"
RAG_RETRIEVAL_COUNT = 5  # How many chunks to retrieve per query
RAG_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.7  # Minimum similarity score to consider
RAG_EMBEDDING_MODEL = "openai/text-embedding-3-small"  # or "anthropic/voyage-2"

# Multi-Agent Configuration
ENABLE_MULTI_AGENT = True  # Master switch for new architecture
SSBA_TIMEOUT = 30.0  # Story structure beat agent timeout
CBA_TIMEOUT = 25.0  # Chapter beat agent timeout
CEA_TIMEOUT = 35.0  # Context editor agent timeout
PA_TIMEOUT = 120.0  # Prose agent timeout (same as current)

# Story Structure
STORY_STRUCTURE_TYPE = "save_the_cat"  # "save_the_cat", "heros_journey", "three_act"
TOTAL_CHAPTERS = 30  # Default story length
```

---

## Cost Estimate

**Per Chapter (Chapters 2-30):**

| Agent | Tokens In | Tokens Out | Cost (Sonnet 3.5) |
|-------|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| SSBA Check-in | ~2,000 | ~500 | $0.008 |
| CBA | ~4,000 | ~1,500 | $0.017 |
| RAG Embeddings | ~3,000 | - | $0.001 |
| CEA | ~5,000 | ~1,800 | $0.020 |
| PA | ~8,000 | ~3,500 | $0.035 |
| Summary | ~2,500 | ~100 | $0.008 |
| **Total** | **~24,500** | **~7,400** | **~$0.089** |

**Current System:** ~$0.16/chapter
**New System:** ~$0.09/chapter (actually CHEAPER due to smaller focused calls!)

**Chapter 1 is slightly more expensive** (~$0.12) due to SSBA full story planning, but still cheaper than current system.

---

## Success Metrics

**How do we know this is working?**

1. **Consistency Score**
   - Track contradictions found by CEA
   - Goal: <1 contradiction per 10 chapters after training period

2. **Generation Time**
   - Target: <180s per chapter (95th percentile)
   - Current: ~145s average, ~280s worst case

3. **User Reports**
   - Track user feedback on story consistency
   - Goal: 80% of users report "very consistent" story

4. **Automated Tests**
   - Create test cases with intentional contradictions
   - Verify CEA catches 90%+ of them

---

## Migration Strategy

**No current users = No backward compatibility needed**

Since there are no active users yet, we can:
- Build the multi-agent system properly from the ground up
- No feature flags or gradual rollouts needed
- Complete system replacement when ready
- Focus on getting it right, not on migration complexity

**Approach:** Hard cutover when multi-agent system passes tests

---

## Decisions Made

### ✅ ALL RESOLVED

1. **CEA Authority:** Auto-fix contradictions without manual intervention (scalability required)

2. **Choice Generation:** CEA generates strategic choices (informed by SSBA + validated beats), NOT PA

3. **Migration Strategy:** Hard cutover, no backward compatibility needed (no current users)

4. **CEA Context Minimum:** Skip Chapter 1 only (start CEA from Chapter 2)

5. **Irreconcilable Contradictions → Story Features!** 🎭
   - When CEA finds contradictions it can't auto-fix, **flag them as plot opportunities**
   - CEA shares flags with SSBA via `inconsistency_flags` field
   - SSBA weaves contradictions into story beats as intentional twists/reveals
   - Example: "Charlie walked in Chapter 15 despite wheelchair" → becomes "Chapter 16 reveals experimental nerve regeneration treatment"
   - **Contradictions become features, not bugs!**

6. **SSBA Structure Updates:** YES - SSBA can update story structure mid-story
   - Especially when resolving inconsistency flags
   - Allows dynamic adaptation to player choices
   - Maintains overall arc while being flexible

7. **User Visibility:** ZERO - All backend operations completely hidden
   - No consistency badges, no debug info shown to users
   - Users experience seamless story, unaware of agent orchestration
   - Backend magic stays invisible

---

## Next Steps

**Ready to implement!** The architecture is now aligned with your vision:

- ✅ Two-level beat system (SSBA + CBA)
- ✅ CEA generates choices AND validates consistency
- ✅ PA writes prose only (no strategic decisions)
- ✅ Auto-fix contradictions (no manual intervention)
- ✅ No backward compatibility needed

**Proposed workflow:**
1. You test current bug fixes on Railway
2. While that's running, I start Phase 1 (RAG infrastructure)
3. Proceed through phases 2-7 to build multi-agent system
4. Test thoroughly before cutover

**Ready to start Phase 1 when you give the word!** 🚀
